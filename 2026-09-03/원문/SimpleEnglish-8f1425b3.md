 ✈️ your AI writes like a LinkedIn post. make it write like a Boeing manual. 


 
 An agent skill that makes LLMs write plain English with the discipline of ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English :

 the controlled language aerospace has used since 1983 so a tired mechanic cannot misread an instruction.

 Layman-readable by default, STE-strict on request. AI slop dies as a side effect.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 


 Works in every agent that reads the Agent Skills standard : Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Goose, OpenCode, and about 25 more. One folder, no dependencies, MIT.

 Install 
 Any agent , with the skills CLI :

 npx skills add AminBlg/SimpleEnglish 
 Try it before you install: npx skills use AminBlg/SimpleEnglish@simple-english 

 Claude Code plugin (skill, session hook, output style):

 claude plugin marketplace add AminBlg/SimpleEnglish && claude plugin install simple-english@simple-english 
 The plugin also ships an output style , named simple-english:simple-english . The short name does not resolve. For one project, run /config , open Output style , and select it. For all projects, put {"outputStyle": "simple-english:simple-english"} in ~/.claude/settings.json and start Claude Code again.

 Codex plugin (skill, session hook):

 codex plugin marketplace add AminBlg/SimpleEnglish
codex plugin add simple-english@simple-english 
 Codex asks you to trust the hook in /hooks before its first run. The hooks need Node.js. Details in src/hooks/README.md .

 No skill support? Paste prompts/system-prompt.md into your system prompt, AGENTS.md , or .cursorrules . It ends with a 60-token version for tight budgets. On claude.ai, ChatGPT, or Gemini, paste it as the first message.

 Then ask for any technical writing, or say: "rewrite this with simple-english" .

 Left is real, unedited Claude output. Right is the same model with the skill loaded.

 Leveraging sqlpipe's robust architecture, users can seamlessly synchronize their Postgres tables to S3 with minimal configuration overhead. Before getting started, you should ensure that your AWS credentials have been properly configured — this is crucial for avoiding frustrating permission issues down the line.

 
 
 
 
 sqlpipe copies your Postgres tables to S3. It needs one configuration file.

 Before you start, make sure that your AWS credentials are correct. If they are not, S3 rejects the upload with a permission error.

 
 
 
 
 More rewrites in examples/before-after.md : READMEs, runbooks, incident reports, error messages, release notes.

 Benchmarks 
 74.6% fewer STE violations per 100 words with the skill on, averaged across 7 Claude models × 8 writing tasks (112 generations). Measured on skill 1.3.0. The 2.0.0 pivot (Plain by default) was checked against 1.3.0 on two models, the reply set, and a blind judge: documents at parity, replies with 43% fewer violations. Details: evals/results/pivot-2026-09-01/RESULTS.md . Deterministic regex linter, same rules for both conditions, reasoning effort pinned to low . Method, caveats, and raw files: evals/results/RESULTS.md . Reproduce with python3 evals/run_bench.py and a logged-in Claude Code CLI.

 The rules 
 53 numbered rules in 9 sections, paraphrased with software examples in SKILL.md . The ones that do the work:

 
 
 
 Rule 
 What it kills 
 
 
 
 
 Max 20 words per instruction, 25 per description 
 The run-on sentence 
 
 
 One word = one meaning, whole document 
 check/verify/confirm/validate roulette 
 
 
 Simple tenses only 
 "has been updated" → "we updated" 
 
 
 No "-ing" verb forms 
 ", making it easy to..." clauses 
 
 
 Active voice 
 "it should be noted that" 
 
 
 No should/would/may/might 
 Hedging. ( can , will , must survive) 
 
 
 Condition BEFORE command 
 Trailing "...if the flag is set" that readers execute too late 
 
 
 One instruction per sentence 
 Steps nobody can follow at 2 a.m. 
 
 
 Keep articles, keep "that" 
 Telegraph style. STE is short, not terse 
 
 
 
 Two modes. Plain (default) writes for a smart reader outside the field: the structural rules, common words, every technical term defined at first use, answer-first replies. Strict adds the STE dictionary discipline to the document when you name STE or compliance. The skill also covers error messages, runbooks, incident reports, release notes, agent prompts, and translation prep: use-cases.md . It does not touch marketing copy, on purpose.

 FAQ 
 Does this make output STE-certified? No. Nothing does, because ASD certifies no tool. Strict mode gets close; word-level rulings live in the official standard, a free download .

 Will my docs sound robotic? They will sound like Airbus manuals: flat and impossible to misread. For docs that is the whole point. Keep your voice for your blog.

 Why not just prompt "write clearly"? "Clearly" is an opinion. "No sentence over 20 words" is a spec. Agents follow specs.

 Why a 40-year-old aerospace standard? It is maintained (Issue 9, January 2025), numbered, and testable. It is also a near-perfect negative of every AI writing tell.

 How was it built? Against the primary Issue 9 text, not summaries. Agents without the skill invented rule numbers, so the skill carries the real ones. A community audit ( #4 ) checked the vocabulary tables against the dictionary; the fix was A/B-tested before it merged. Scenarios and recorded results: evals/pressure-tests.md .
