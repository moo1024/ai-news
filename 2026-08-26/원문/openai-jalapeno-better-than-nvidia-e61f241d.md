 Subscribe Sign in OpenAI Jalapeño: Better Than Nvidia Blackwell OpenAI’s self-designed ASIC compared with Rubin, Jalapeño’s TCO, throughput per MW, and spicy deets Bryan Shan , Myron Xie , Jordan Nanos , and 3 others Aug 25, 2026 ∙ Paid 161 1 20 Share OpenAI has spent the past couple years quietly building “Jalapeño,” an inference chip just announced at Hot Chips. Rumors of a successful tapeout had been swirling for a while. But now we have details. OpenAI invited us to look at their chip, go to their labs to check out how real it is, and benchmark it with our InferenceX suite. 
 In June, OpenAI unveiled the chip program in partnership with Broadcom, built from a blank slate exclusively for LLM inference. Design work began in the middle of 2024 , going from initial team hiring to manufacturing tape-out in ~16 months, an extremely fast ASIC development cycle. 
 In general first generation chips are not competitive, but OpenAI bucks the trend by being industry leading and beating every Nvidia, AMD, and Google chip we have been able to test on multiple top open source models. OpenAI does this with extreme hardware software codesign. Surprisingly, OpenAI is not over specialization on any specific part of model inference, but instead by focusing on being a general chip that delivers high performance in all scenarios. 
 In this article, we will go into architectural details, software details and performance results for Jalapeño on InferenceX. 
 Source: OpenAI A generalized inference chip Everyone says that OpenAI’s chip is specialized for OpenAI models, but that’s wrong, OpenAI made a generalized chip for AI inference. 
 The timelines are insane. It shows that claims that use of AI is being used to accelerate chip design are real. Regardless of the quick timelines,Open AI spent a bunch of money, made pragmatic design decisions and their team is cracked, so this comes as no surprise. 
 Just looking at the specs, it is an immediate contender: 
 Source: SemiAnalysis And the use of HBM4 makes it stand out as comparable to flagship GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD: 
 Source: OpenAI A lot of the media coverage of this chip has followed a few throwaway comments from OpenAI that claim the chip will be optimized for their models in a way that other chips are not. This is wrong. Jalapeño is a generalized inference chip capable of running all sorts of models, and all sorts of workloads, including our benchmark InferenceX, where we ran the benchmark with OpenAI engineers in the lab. As a joke, OpenAI even showed us it running Doom, which was ported to their chip with just Codex prompts. 
 The following is our headline perf/W result, looking at token throughput per All-in utility MW. Jalapeño smokes every other chip . All this is done without Multi Token Prediction (MTP), while the other chips on the chart are the best performing configs of each respective SKU, all with MTP. 
 Source: SemiAnalysis Jalapeño beats Blackwell on perf/W across almost all scenarios without being tuned for any specific point in the curve. It excels not only in low-latency scenarios but also in high-throughput scenarios. A more apples to apples comparison is against Single Token Prediction results, it knocks every competitor out of the water. At low concurrency scenarios, Jalapeño demonstrates remarkable interactivity, hitting over 700 tokens per sec per user at concurrency 1 on the DeepSeek R1 model. 
 Incredibly, this is all achieved with single-token prediction (STP), no speculative decoding and no prefill-decode disaggregation. In addition to DeepSeek R1, we also got to see some other models, including Kimi-K2.5 and GPT-OSS which ran at approximately 1,400 tok/sec/user. For all models, we confirmed that Jalapeño’s GSM8k evals attained results on par with Nvidia chips. 
 Some caveats on this. First, all numbers are provided to us by OpenAI. We verified the InferenceX runs in person in the lab, but we did not run the full suite of InferenceX benchmarks nor have we seen AgentX results. AgentX is our preferred suite for comparing chip performance due to the datasets’ long context and multi-turn characteristics that reflect the cache behavior of realistic production workflows. Frameworks that perform well on 8k1k may perform worse on AgentX as real production loads stress components like routers, prefix cache mechanisms, cache management, offload infrastructure, etc. These are not tested by single turn 8k1k.

Jalapeño is really competing against chips like Rubin that also use HBM4. Vera Rubin systems are starting to ship to customers right now, while it will still be some time before OpenAI has anything beyond engineering samples of Jalapeño. 
 Thus, performance should really be compared against Rubin, not Blackwell, and in some sense we expect a custom chip like Jalapeño to outperform Blackwell. Vera Rubin NVL72 delivers 5.4x the perf/MW of GB200 NVL72 as we described in our article analyzing the NVIDIA performance claims in their launch with CoreWeave last month . We will compare Jalapeño to Vera Rubin’s July performance figures later below.

NVIDIA and AMD have published results on larger models such as DeepSeek V4 Pro and Kimi K3, using AgentX. The larger the model and the more recent the release, the more complicated it is to bring up on a new chip. With that said the models OpenAI has working on Jalapeno aren’t exactly small either. 
 Performance Analysis OpenAI designs for perf/W. The reason is simple: OpenAI is currently limited by datacenter power, not by budget or floorspace, and thus tokens per MW is paramount. At Computex 2026, Jensen said that perf/W, reliability and long lifetime are the core features of future GPUs. To quote: “If you have 1 gigawatt of power, then throughput per watt is revenue”. He also mentioned that choosing the wrong architecture just because the chips are cheaper doesn’t make sense. 
 Source: Computex 2026 keynote This was emphasized by Nvidia during the Vera talk at Hot Chips 2026 while showing the same revenue graph: “The data center is power limited today.” Power matters and drives revenue. 
 Operators cannot simply obtain more MW because adding GPUs and adding grid capacity happen on very different timescales. Datacenter power envelopes have constraints such as their utility interconnection, infrastructure, cooling capacity, and UPS/backup-generation design. Grid delays repeatedly outpace hardware and construction timelines, driving the need for BtM (behind-the-meter) power capacity: gas turbines and on-site generators built and located at the data center itself. This capacity sits behind the utility’s meter rather than being drawn from the public grid. It lets an operator power a facility without waiting on grid interconnection and utility upgrades, which is exactly why xAI’s Colossus 2 relies so heavily on BtM while its actual grid connection lags far behind. Find out more in our Energy model . 
 As we wrote in an X post, tok/s/MW reduces to tokens per joule since a watt is a joule per second. This makes tok/s/MW representative of a system’s efficiency and ability to convert energy into tokens. 
 Source: SemiAnalysis On this front, even when compared with Rubin, Jalapeño wins. OpenAI’s Jalapeño has STP output token throughput per MW surpassing Vera Rubin’s MTP results that NVIDIA and CoreWeave published in July. It also far exceeds GB200’s 2025 MTP results. As mentioned in our Vera Rubin article, VR was compared to 2025 GB200 results because that was a similar stage of early bring-up, and comparing to GB200 in 2025 holds software maturity constant. Following this logic, we compare Vera Rubin’s latest July 2026 results, GB200 2025 results, and today’s Jalapeño results. This is a very valid comparison as these are the best public Rubin numbers, and OpenAI taped out their chip after Rubin. Both OpenAI and Rubin are still immature thus performance will continue to rise. 
 Source: OpenAI, SemiAnalysis On perf/TCO, Vera Rubin and Jalapeño are head-to-head, producing almost the same number of output tokens per $. However, as previously mentioned, Jalapeño’s results are obtained without speculative decoding and Vera Rubin’s results use speculative decoding. Speculative decoding leads to a ~3-5x reduction in cost per token. When speculative decoding is implemented on Jalapeño, this will enable Jalapeño to serve tokens even more cost effectively. Of course, part of this TCO advantage comes from trading Nvidia’s high margins for Broadcom’s lower (though still high) margins. But this is not all of it. For example, Meta and Microsoft’s AI ASIC programs not getting off the ground despite being at it for much longer shows that cost is only one part of the equation. For Jalapeño’s full TCO breakdown, see the SemiAnalysis AI Cloud TCO model . 
 Source: OpenAI, SemiAnalysis Architecturally, OpenAI chose not to disaggregate prefill and decode (PD) across separate chip pools. The draft model and main model share the same chips and fabric, a design philosophy that trades some theoretical efficiency for practical operations. The motivation is that the workload mix changes over time, for example the ratio of input to cache write to cache read to output tokens has changed significantly as we have moved through the three eras of models ( knowledge, reasoning, and agentic, as discussed in our recent article ). Therefore, picking a fixed amount of heterogenous prefill silicon and decode silicon up front can lead to inefficiencies over time. OpenAI chooses a homogenous pool in this architecture and tries to make the chip perform well on everything. 
 And it does. On Kimi K2.5 (which Cursor Composer 2.5 is based on), Jalapeño reaches nearly 700tok/s/user and more than 9x the next best performing chip at 100tok/s/user. 
 Source: OpenAI, SemiAnalysis On GPT-OSS, it’s another bloodbath. Jalapeño’s iso-interactivity throughput per MW is nearly double GB200’s highest throughput point and more than 50x GB200’s concurrency 1 point. The higher concurrency Jalapeño points use EP8. 
 Source: OpenAI, SemiAnalysis These results are impressive! However, we have to nitpick: they’re just 8k1k, a much easier workload to tune for, and there are no AgentX runs yet. As mentioned in our AgentX article, multiturn, long context workloads stress much more aspects of the serving stack, such as routers and prefix cache. Many more optimizations are needed to excel in agentic workloads. Read more about this in the AgentX article. 
 AgentX - InferenceXv3: Does CUDA Moat Hold up in Agentic Inferencing? Cam Quilici , Bryan Shan , and 5 others · Aug 24 Read full story Digging into the specs and architecture All these results were gathered on the A0 stepping of Jalapeño, just 9 months into the program. But there is already a B0 stepping that is currently in the fab! B0 has optimizations that deliver roughly a 25% perf-per-watt improvement over the earlier A0 silicon. Specifically, the B0 stepping delivers 13.4 PFLOPs of MXFP4 on a single reticle-sized compute die that is manufactured on TSMC’s N3P. This compares to 17.5 PFLOPs of dense Rubin NVFP4 for a single Rubin compute die that is similar size and on the same node. 
 This is more respectable considering Jalapeño’s TDP is only 700W compared to Rubin’s at 900-1,150W per compute die. As Jalapeño is geared towards inference rather than training, it is understandable that OpenAI doesn’t need to push TDPs higher to maximize FLOPs, but regardless the above shows that Jalapeño delivers respectable peak theoretical FLOPs. 
 When compared directly to other accelerators, Jalapeño has the highest HBM bandwidth per watt, and the highest FLOPs per watt, comparable to the 1,800W Rubin Max-Q configuration: 
 Source: SemiAnalysis Off-package I/O is provided by an N3E I/O chiplet with 32 lanes of 800G SerDes, for the compute fabric, with 24 lanes (600GB/s) being used for local scale-up within the rack, and 8 lanes (200GB/s) for global scale-up which is the 2,048 XPU multi-rack domain. PCIe Gen 5 is used for system I/O to connect to the x86 host CPU. 
 Jalapeño will ship with HBM4, making this chip one of the relatively early adopters after Nvidia and AMD, even beating the established TPU and Trainium programs. As one of the key architectural principles behind Jalapeño is getting the most out of HBM bandwidth, settling for anything but the best HBM would run counter to that goal. This results in 15.4TB/s of memory bandwidth per package which bests all the other accelerators shipping that are using HBM3E. The 15.4TB/s bandwidth shows its HBM4 can hit 10Gbps pin speeds, which would give it a slight edge over the 9.6Gbps Nvidia is getting out of its HBM4 in Rubin. The HBM is likely provided by Samsung. 
 Source: OpenAI OpenAI taped out Jalapeño in November 2025, or more specifically, this was a tape out of the CoWoS design, not just the top die silicon. Within 9 months of that Nov 2025 tapeout, and with only 3 months of bring-up on actual silicon, OpenAI has already delivered very good results with Jalapeño. This is all the more impressive as the team is starting from zero on the software stack. 
 Meanwhile, Rubin’s CoWoS tape out was complete
