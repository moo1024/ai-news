 TL;DR
 
 
 We introduce NeoMME , a family of 260M and 800M multilingual multimodal encoders. Unlike many generative visual language models, NeoMME does not use a separate pretrained vision tower or a causal language model. A single bidirectional Transformer processes both text tokens and raw image patches, and we train the entire model from scratch with a masked discrete-diffusion objective.

 We fine-tuned NeoMME for visual document retrieval using ColPali's page-image approach. NeoMME -Retriever returns dense and late-interaction embeddings in one forward pass. Both model sizes lie on the ViDoRe v3 Pareto frontier for nDCG@10 and model size. At a matched 2048×2048 image input size on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, the 260M model encodes about 51 pages per second, or about twice ColModernVBERT's throughput. Hierarchical token pooling and asymmetric quantization reduce late-interaction index storage from roughly 1.5 MB to 6 kB per page (255× smaller) while retaining more than 95% of baseline nDCG@10.

 NeoMME is available in Hugging Face Transformers. We release all model checkpoints under the Apache 2.0 license.

 Why another multimodal encoder?
 
 
 Many recent visual document retrievers are adapted from pretrained generative visual language models. A separately pretrained vision encoder produces visual features, which a projector maps into the language model's input space. A causal decoder then processes the combined image and text representations. Retrieval, classification, and token labeling do not generate text autoregressively, so they do not require a causal decoder or the parameter and compute overhead of this architecture.

 ModernBERT brought efficient architecture and training improvements to bidirectional encoders. For visual document retrieval, ModernVBERT applied a bidirectional ModernBERT-style text encoder while retaining a separate pretrained SigLIP2 vision tower. We wanted to push this even further by designing and training a multimodal encoder without having to carry over the parameter and compute overhead of a VLM.

 NeoMME (pronounced "nee-oh-me", IPA /ˈniː.oʊ.mi/) is a multilingual, multimodal foundation encoder that generates vector representations for input text and/or images using a single Transformer encoder. It is not based on an existing pretrained vision tower, text encoder, or text decoder.

 
 
 Unlike dual-tower and VLM encoders, NeoMME processes image patches and text tokens in one bidirectional Transformer, without a pretrained vision tower or a pretrained text encoder or decoder. 
 

 Images and text use the same computational path, so NeoMME can more easily support pretraining, fine-tuning, parallelization, and serving across both modalities.

 One Transformer for images and text
 
 
 NeoMME comes in two sizes, 260M and 800M . Both variants share the same architecture:

 
 Native multimodal inputs: text inputs use factorized token embeddings, while images are divided into a grid of non-overlapping 32×32 patches and projected with a small MLP. Both enter the same Transformer encoder. 
 Dynamic image resolution: images keep their aspect ratio and size. This allows the model to use more tokens on a high-resolution, information-dense document page than on a smaller image with less content. 
 Long bidirectional context: both models have a context length of 16,384 tokens (enough for up to two standard 3840×2160 4K UHD images). Most layers use symmetric sliding-window attention, while every sixth layer and the final layer use global attention. 
 A modern encoder stack: NeoMME uses recent encoder improvements such as grouped-query attention, query-key normalization, gated attention, 2D rotary position embeddings, and squared-ReLU MLPs, among others. 
 Multilingual text: we trained a BPE tokenizer with a 131k-token vocabulary from scratch on multilingual text, code, mathematics, and machine-produced image transcripts.

 Learning from images through masked text
 
 
 We pretrain NeoMME from scratch as a discrete masked-diffusion text denoiser. For each text-only example, we sample a corruption rate uniformly between 0 and 1. Each eligible text token is then independently masked at that rate.

 Multimodal examples use corruption rates between 0.3 and 1. The image patches remain visible while NeoMME reconstructs masked text. With light masking, the model can often recover a missing word from the surrounding text alone. For example, "cat" is a plausible completion of "The [MASK] sat on the mat," even without an image. But high masking forces the model to learn image-grounded descriptions with little to no signal from the non-masked input text tokens.

 
 
 Higher text corruption removes language-only shortcuts and encourages NeoMME to use visible image evidence. 
 

 Pretraining mixes multilingual text, code, mathematics, natural images, and document images. Each model processes about 524 billion packed input tokens, including 290 billion tokens from text-only examples. This text budget is relatively small compared with ModernBERT's 2 trillion training token budget. Hence, we chose the NorMuon optimizer to improve data efficiency during training.

 
 
 
 
 
 NeoMME -Retriever
 
 
 To get a meaningful downstream evaluation of the backbone, we fine-tune NeoMME for visual document retrieval using the page-image methodology introduced by ColPali . While traditional text-based retrieval consists of retrieving text chunks, NeoMME -Retriever ranks document page screenshots and bypasses all the preprocessing OCR steps necessary to extract text from PDFs. Treating the pages as images preserves layout, charts, tables, font type and size, and other visual clues that cannot be captured even by a perfect OCR model.

 
 
 
 
 
 A dual-head design for dense and late-interaction retrieval
 
 
 NeoMME -Retriever reuses the NeoMME backbone but adds two jointly trained heads on top of it for retrieval:

 
 The dense head averages the backbone's hidden state vectors into a normalized vector (mean pooling). Dense embeddings are most common today: they are compact and work naturally with approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) techniques for fast retrieval. 
 The late-interaction head projects each text token or image patch from the backbone's output hidden states to a 128-dimensional normalized vector. Compared to dense embeddings, the finer granularity preserves local matches between individual query tokens and image regions. 
 
 
 
 Late-interaction and dense retrieval heads for both NeoMME model sizes. 
 

 
 Omar Khattab, who introduced late-interaction in ColBERT, explains why the term is more precise than "multi-vector." It describes the granularity and learnability of the scoring function, not simply the number of stored vectors.

 To learn more about late-interaction, we recommend reading this crash course by Amélie Chatelain.

 
 One NeoMME -Retriever forward pass returns both representations, which gives you flexibility no matter your use case and infrastructure. We recommend using late-interaction embeddings in general since they are more powerful and can be used easily with open-source libraries like NextPlaid . However, if you have a very large corpora, you can run a single forward pass with NeoMME -Retriever to get the dense embedding, retrieve a small number of documents through an ANN index, and then use late-interaction to rerank the retrieved candidates.

 
 
 
 
 
 Competitive retrieval at compact model sizes
 
 
 We report nDCG@10 on ViDoRe v3. NeoMME -Retriever-260M reaches 0.523, the highest score among evaluated models strictly below 800M parameters. It is within 0.002 nDCG@10 of ColQwen2.5 while using about 14× fewer parameters. NeoMME -Retriever-800M reaches 0.556, within 0.009 nDCG@10 of the similarly sized Vultron Retriever Flash (0.8B) . Both NeoMME -Retriever models lie on the model-size Pareto frontier.

 ViDoRe v1 and v2 use nDCG@5. On both benchmarks, NeoMME -Retriever-260M outperforms ColModernVBERT and the twice-larger ColSmol-500M. NeoMME -Retriever-800M outperforms ColPali v1.3 while using 3.6 times fewer parameters.

 Making high-resolution retrieval practical for late-interaction
 
 
 Late-interaction storage scales linearly with the number of vectors in the output embedding. Higher-resolution images contain more patches, so they produce larger embeddings. For example, a 2048×2048 square page produces embeddings containing 4,200 vectors with NeoMME -Retriever, or about 2.1 MB in float32. Across the ViDoRe v3 benchmark, the measured average is about 1.5 MB per document.

 To reduce the storage footprint of the late-interaction index, we combine two complementary compression methods:

 
 Hierarchical token pooling clusters similar document vectors in a given multi-vector embedding and replaces each cluster with its mean, hence reducing the number of vectors stored for each page. 
 Asymmetric quantization quantizes document embeddings to int8 or binary. Because query embeddings are not stored and only generated on-the-fly, they can be kept at a higher precision. 
 
 We tested this setup on ViDoRe v3. With a pooling factor 10 and int8 queries and documents, storage decreased from about 1.5 MB to 39 kB per page, a 39× reduction, while keeping more than 99% of the baseline nDCG@10. A more aggressive configuration uses pooling factor 8, int8 queries, and binary documents. That version uses 6 kB per page (255× smaller) and keeps more than 95% of the original retrieval quality.

 Users can pick a compression setting from that frontier based on storage budget and required retrieval quality.

 
 
 
 
 
 Fast inference for cheaper multimodal corpus indexing
 
 
 Before you can search a corpus, a retriever model must turn your documents into embeddings, which will be stored in a vector store like Qdrant, Weaviate, or Milvus. Faster encoding makes building and adding new documents to the index faster, thus reducing the GPU uptime and compute cost required.

 So we measured image encoding speeds for NeoMME -Retriever against other multimodal document retrievers. We used preprocessed image tensors and calibrated the batch size separately for each model and image size. At a matched 2048×2048 input size on one NVIDIA L40S, NeoMME -Retriever-260M encodes about 51 pages per second, nearly twice ColModernVBERT's 26 pages per second. Both 260M and 800M NeoMME -Retriever models are also faster than the other models we compared on smaller input images.
