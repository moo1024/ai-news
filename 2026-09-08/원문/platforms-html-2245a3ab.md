 Instinct 
 Summary 
 
 
 
 
 
 One awesome product evolution is that agents (Claude Code, Instinct, Poke, etc) are moving off our local computers so that we can use them on our phones.
Ultimately this is great for the customer because that means the agent companies provide us with VMs for them to run on! Here's some notes on how the major platforms work based on looking around on ws-term .

 Claude Code on Your Phone 
 Claude Code's box is its own Firecracker microVM , a KVM guest with its
own kernel, booted straight into an init written in Rust:

 $ cat /proc/cmdline
... rdinit=/process_api ... --listen-vsock-port 2024
$ uname -r
6.18.5-fc-v20 # -fc- = Firecracker; a custom-built guest kernel
$ ps -o comm -p 1
process_api # PID 1 is not systemd; it's a Rust/Tokio binary
 
 process_api is PID 1 and the host's control agent living
inside your VM: it mounts the disks, then listens on vsock port 2024 so the
host can drive the session from outside. That's the platform's defining trait:
 the operator lives inside your tenant space , and a lot of engineering goes into
sealing it off (PID 1 is non-dumpable, /proc/1/mem is denied even with
 CAP_SYS_PTRACE , your shell is missing CAP_SYS_RESOURCE ).

 The disks split cleanly into yours (writable, persistent) and theirs 
(read-only, shared):

 $ lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,RO,MOUNTPOINT
vda 256G 0 / # yours: writable, survives reclaim
vdc 341M 1 /opt/claude-code # theirs: the 324 MB `claude` harness (Bun)
vdd 45.6M 1 /opt/env-runner # theirs: the task launcher
vde/vdf ... 1 /mnt/skills/... # theirs: skills
 
 The harness is the thing running your tool calls and is a 324 MB compiled Bun
binary on a read-only disk. The model runs elsewhere; inference goes out as Server-Sent Events over HTTPS/2 (not a WebSocket) to /v1/messages , through an egress gateway that is 443-only and
MITM'd ( CN = Egress Gateway ... (production) ), with api.anthropic.com pinned
in /etc/hosts . There is no inbound at all ( 192.0.2.2 , an RFC-5737 test
address). Auth is a host-minted OAuth token , cached root-only on disk and
rotated per boot.

 Lifecycle is host-driven and measured from the inside: ~430 ms to init,
 ~6.4 s to the harness process. Spin-up is triggered by an inbound message
(the host wakes the VM over vsock and runs --session-mode resume ); spin-down is
idle reclaim decided by the host. When it's reclaimed, the processes die but
 vda detaches intact and reattaches on the next cold boot, which is why the
conversation feels continuous even though the compute was destroyed.

 Instinct 
 Instinct is a new startup which launched recently and it does some very nice things on the memory side which gives that feel of it being a real assistant rather than a chatbot.

 $ hostname
e2b.local
$ cat /.e2b
n038afjvewg7jnc9pwdz
 
 e2b.local means Instinct doesn't operate its own VM fleet; it rents
 E2B sandboxes ("sandbox-as-a-service"), a throwaway Ubuntu box
you hand an agent so it has a computer:

 Ubuntu 22.04.5, 2 vCPU, 1.9 GB RAM, 29 GB disk, up ~30 min, user sandbox (uid 1001)
 
 And let's look under the hood...

 $ systemd-detect-virt → kvm
$ cat /proc/cmdline
 pci=off virtio_mmio.device=4K@... i8042.noaux i8042.nokbd reboot=k panic=1
 clocksource=kvm-clock root=/dev/vda ip=169.254.0.21::...:eth0:off:tap0
$ cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_name → (empty) # no SMBIOS at all
$ ps -o comm -p 1 → systemd # init=/sbin/init, not a custom PID 1
 
 Firecracker again!

 pci=off + virtio-over-MMIO + empty DMI + tap0 networking is the Firecracker
signature: no PCI bus, no SMBIOS, minimal devices. So both apps sit on the
 same microVM; the difference is who runs the fleet and what boots inside it. 
Where Claude Code boots a stripped custom init ( process_api as PID 1), E2B boots a
full Ubuntu with systemd and a whole XFCE desktop:

 $ systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 265ms (kernel) + 992ms (userspace) = 1.258s
graphical.target reached after 977ms
 
 ~1.26 s to cold-boot all the way to a graphical desktop. The operator-in-guest exists
here too, but it's just E2B's envd running as an ordinary systemd service, not a
sealed PID 1. E2B sandboxes are configurable too (you pick the vCPU, RAM, disk, and idle
timeout, and whether the box can be paused and resumed from a memory snapshot instead of
cold-booted); Instinct runs a modest 2 vCPU / 1.9 GB desktop template.

 So if the box is disposable, where does the agent's memory live? In a directory
called /memory , and this is the platform's defining idea:

 $ cat /memory/README.md
Persistent memory for [[rohan-adwankar]]
$ ls /memory
entities/ comms/ timeline/ workstreams/ knowledge/
$ git -C /memory log --format='%an <%ae>' -1
Instinct Agent <agent@instinct.com>
 
 The agent's memory is a git repo of Markdown files with [[wiki-links]] ,
navigated by grep . The timeline/ coarsens over time (raw → hourly → daily →
weekly, like human memory), and the agent is literally the git author : it
doesn't call a memory API, it writes Markdown and commits it as itself.

 The durable layer is that repo, pushed to S3 , keyed by a per-user id, and
stored not as files but as a single git bundle , which is a great little gotcha:

 $ git -C /memory remote -v
origin s3://instinct-prod-agent-memory/filesystem-memory/user-01M1VW7...
$ aws s3 ls s3://.../user-01M1VW7.../ --recursive
 HEAD
 refs/heads/main/<sha>.bundle # the ENTIRE vault, packed; `ls` after sync looks empty
 
 Auth is short-lived STS credentials , not long-lived keys, so a leaked
sandbox self-heals when the token lapses:

 $ cat /etc/instinct-aws-creds
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='ASIA…' # ASIA prefix + session token = temporary STS
... # (values redacted, live secrets)
# role: instinct-sandbox-observations-role
 
 flowchart TB
 subgraph box["E2B sandbox (rented, disposable)"]
 agent["Instinct Agent (agent@instinct.com)"] -->|writes and commits| mem["/memory, a Markdown vault git repo"]
 creds["/etc/instinct-aws-creds, short-lived STS"]
 end
 mem -->|git push| store
 creds -->|authorizes git push| store
 subgraph store["S3 (durable, per-user)"]
 vault[("instinct-prod-agent-memory, the vault")]
 obs[("instinct-prod-observations, raw firehose")]
 end 
 Durable thing = a git repo in S3. The machine is throwaway. 

 Using a git repo for this is quite nice; the default structure seems to be like this:

 Now Claude Code's harness in the VM is open source and the same as normal but how about Instinct?

 $ ps -eo args | grep -E 'agent-exec|tools'
agent-exec-server --port 8080 # Go, runs the bash/code it's sent
tools __internal_daemon --socket /tmp/.tools/bridge.sock \
 --base-url https://api.instinct.com/-/api/graphql/tool-execute # Rust
$ strings /usr/local/bin/tools /usr/local/bin/agent-exec-server \
 | grep -iE 'anthropic|openai|/v1/messages|x-api-key|claude|gpt|model'
 # → nothing. no model listed
 
 So it seems like there are no inference calls anywhere on the box. Claude Code seals the operator 
inside the guest; Instinct doesn't put the brain in the guest at all. The sandbox
is a pure execution surface : agent-exec-server runs whatever bash the backend
hands it, and every tool call (Gmail, the cloud browser, a payment) leaves as a
 GraphQL request to api.instinct.com , executed server-side. The --base-url 
is a runtime argument, not compiled in.

 For the actual tool surface, rather than MCPs, Instinct seems to use a CLI for all tools:

 sandbox@e2b:~/ws-term-v1$ tools --help | wc
 90 1466 10891
sandbox@e2b:~/ws-term-v1$ tools --help
Tools CLI

You are a task agent. Your parent (the main agent) spawned you for a focused job. When the job is done, report back to your parent and hold. Your parent owns task-agent cleanup.

Your direct-execute traits:
 - work - integrations, files, web page fetching
....

Run `tools --help` for the current surface.

USAGE
 tools <command-path> [options]
 tools help [<path>...]

....

Built-ins (no help read needed): help, async wait, async list.

EXECUTABLE (you can call these directly)
 agent_message namespace (1 action) Send messages to other agents.
 browser_guidance namespace (3 actions) Search per-config website guidance and this user's past outcomes before browser navigation, and record how a config performed after an attempt. Missing guidance is normal and means unknown, not supported or blocked.
 cloud_browser namespace (27 actions) Drive a cloud-hosted Chrome lease with the user's saved logins. Use for agent-driven web tasks (order food, book rides, compare prices, fetch receipts) that need real authenticated capability on real sites. A task agent acquires its own `lease_id` with `tools cloud_browser_scheduler acquire` and drives it here.

....

DELEGATED (only callable by the other role)
 account namespace (2 actions) Read the user's Instinct account profile.
 feedback namespace (3 actions) Submit product feedback and respond to team follow-ups.
 generate_referral_link action Ask the main agent to get the member's reusable referral link and current lifetime allowance.
 revoke_referral_link action Ask the main agent to revoke the member's reusable referral link.
 speak action Generate a WAV speech file from a transcript, optional director's notes, and a voice.

UNAVAILABLE (does not apply to this role)
 steer_voice_agent action Send an answer or context into the user's active live voice session.
 
 The tool surface is the tell that this box isn't a coding sandbox at all.
 tools --help lists ~50 namespaces (Gmail, Notion, Slack, Stripe payments, a
credential vault), but the one that reveals the design is the cloud browser :

 $ tools --help | grep -iE 'cloud_browser|vault'
cloud_browser (27) Drive a cloud-hosted Chrome lease with the user's saved logins.
cloud_browser_scheduler (4) acquire, list, release, extend leases
vault (7) Manage, fill, and import the user's stored credentials
 
 When Instinct orders food or books a flight "as you," it does not open a
browser on this sandbox. It leases one from a separate pool of cloud browsers,
each carrying your saved profile (cookies and logins) and drives it through the
same api.instinct.com bridge:

 tools cloud_browser_scheduler acquire # → lease_id, on a browser "config" (a profile)
tools cloud_browser <action> # click / type / read / screenshot that Chrome
 
 You can read the whole model off how leases behave: each profile has exactly one
write lease (the only session allowed to save new logins), up to five run at
once, and releasing a lease "saves its cookies first, so the next lease loads
them." That persistence is the point: your browser identity is a third durable
thing , sitting server-side next to the S3 vault and the observations index, kept
so a disposable box can borrow it for one task and hand it back. Two details let
it sign in without a secret ever touching the box:

 
 Scout before navigating. tools browser_guidance search returns curated
 per-site notes plus your own past outcomes per profile ( config-a: success ,
 config-b: blocked ), a risk prior, not a verdict. 
 Secrets go through the Vault, never chat. tools vault fill types a stored
 credential straight into the page; when the vault lacks one, tools vault
 request mints a link you fill ( app.instinct.com/vault/fill?t=… ). One-time
 codes it reads itself from your connected Gmail or Outlook.
