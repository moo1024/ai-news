 September 12, 2026 CadQuery vs OpenSCAD for AI-generated functional parts We gave six AI agents the same three printable parts to model, three in CadQuery and three in OpenSCAD, then verified every mesh independently. Both toolchains shipped. The difference is in how they fail.

That choice is worth re-testing occasionally, so we ran a controlled comparison against the most credible alternative for code-first CAD: CadQuery , a Python library on top of the OpenCascade B-rep kernel.

 The question was narrow: which one can an AI agent drive to a correct, printable, functional part with nobody watching? How pleasant each is to write by hand did not come into it.

 Six agents, three tasks, two tools. Every resulting STL was then checked by a parser that trusts neither tool.

 All six parts came out printable. Capability turned out to be the boring part of the answer. Where the two diverge is in how they fail.

 
 The hardest task in the set, solved by both tools. OpenSCAD on the left, CadQuery on the right. 

 Setup 
 All six runs were driven by Claude Opus 5 (1M context) through Claude Code. Each cell ran as a separate general-purpose subagent inheriting that same model, with no cross-talk between them. One agent per cell, so part of the spread below is agent variance rather than tool difference. Tool versions were CadQuery 2.8.0 on Python 3.14 and OpenSCAD 2026.06.12, both on an M-series Mac.

 The OpenSCAD side ran on our own openscad-skill , the agent skill we publish and use in house. It covers file and version naming, the render-inspect-fix QA loop, camera presets for CLI previews, cross-section debugging, and Customizer syntax.

 For CadQuery we ported that skill operation by operation, keeping the same structure and replacing only what has no OpenSCAD equivalent. CadQuery has no CLI renderer, so the port needed a small offscreen renderer written for it, plus B-rep validity metrics in place of the CSG status line. Both files then got the same 3D-printing design rules, wall thickness, clearances and overhangs, so neither side was handed advice the other lacked. Sizes landed at 12.4 KB for OpenSCAD and 13.1 KB for CadQuery.

 One asymmetry survived: the CadQuery file carries an API cheatsheet the OpenSCAD file does not need, because the model already knows OpenSCAD syntax well. That helps CadQuery on syntax and does nothing for it on geometry.

 Each agent was capped at 12 versions, told never to fake success, and required to report every failure with its verbatim error text. They ran unattended.

 We did not take the agents’ word for anything. Every final STL went through a parser that reads the file directly and reports triangle count, bounding box, volume, watertightness, non-manifold and boundary edges, flipped faces, and connected components. That turned out to matter more than we expected, for reasons further down.

 The three tasks 
 Both agents on a task got the same text, with no tool-specific hints.

 The simple one, T1, was a wall-mounted shelf L-bracket: two plates at 90 degrees, 4 thick, two triangular gussets, two countersunk holes for flat-head screws at 90 degrees and 9 head diameter, two plain holes, R3 on the outer vertical corners, R4 fillet on the inner corner, printable without supports.

 T2 raised the stakes to a two-part snap-fit enclosure for a 50 x 26 PCB. Walls 2, cavity clearance 0.4 per side, four M2 posts, a 9.5 x 3.5 USB-C cutout, a separate lid with a peripheral lip at 0.2 clearance and working snaps, five vent slots. The two parts had to actually fit.

 T3 was the hard one: an M24x2 threaded hose-barb adapter with a hex flange 30 across flats, a real helical thread 12 long, a 25 long barb carrying three barbs for 12 ID hose, and an 8 through-channel. The spec explicitly banned stacked rings. The thread had to be true helical geometry.

 Results

 Summed across the three tasks:

 OpenSCAD CadQuery Versions 11 11 Lines of code 473 573 Errors the tool raised 2 5 Silent wrong geometry 5 4 Agent wall-clock 2061 s 2406 s Agent tokens 297 k 347 k 
 “Clean” means watertight, one connected component, zero non-manifold or boundary edges, sitting on z = 0, measured from the file rather than reported by the tool that wrote it.

 Iteration count came out identical at 11 versions each. So did the broad shape of the effort. What differs is the character of the problems each agent hit.

 T1: the simple bracket 
 
 Both correct, shown from the inner corner so the gussets are visible. The visible difference is interpretation: the spec left gusset size and inset open. 

 Rounding the four outer corners separates the two models of the world cleanly. OpenSCAD rounds a 2D profile and extrudes it, so the operation does not care how the solid was assembled:

 module corner_mask() { 
 translate ([ 0 , 0 , - eps]) linear_extrude(vert_h + 2 * eps) 
 offset(r = corner_r) offset(delta = - corner_r) square([plate_w, horiz_d]); 
 } 
 CadQuery has to name the four edges first, and naming is the hard part:

 result = result.edges( "|Z" ).edges( 
 BoxSelector(( - WIDTH , - EPS , - EPS ), ( WIDTH , EPS , V_HEIGHT + EPS )) 
 + BoxSelector(( - WIDTH , H_DEPTH - EPS , - EPS ), ( WIDTH , H_DEPTH + EPS , V_HEIGHT + EPS )) 
 ).fillet( R_OUTER ) 
 OpenSCAD compiled correct geometry on the first attempt and finished in two versions. CadQuery spent about a third of its run on a single error: .fillet(3.0) failed with BRep_API: command not done , a message that names neither the edge nor the radius. The agent had to bisect by hand to discover the cause, which turned out to be arithmetic: two R3 fillets do not fit in a 4 mm wall.

 T2: two parts that must fit 
 
 Both agents derived the same 54.8 x 30.8 x 25.0 mm box from the clearance stack-up. 

 This is where CadQuery’s parameter chain earned its keep. Changing the lip depth moved rim, plate, slots, groove and barb together, because each dimension is derived rather than typed twice. That kind of dimension chain is the same thing a good parametric UI exposes to the user, which we wrote about in Building a better OpenSCAD customizer . CadQuery has no Customizer equivalent, so the constants block is the entire parameter interface.

 More interesting is how each side checked the fit. OpenSCAD prints numbers for someone to read:

 echo ( str ( "cavity LxW = " , cav_l, " x " , cav_w, " (clearance/side " , pcb_clr, ")" )); 
 CadQuery asserts, and the build stops when the assertion is false:

 assert BOX .val().intersect( LID .val()).Volume() < 1e-6 , "box and lid interfere" 
 An echo only helps if somebody reads it. An assert fails the build on its own. For unattended generation that gap is most of the story.

 OpenSCAD needed eight versions to CadQuery’s five, and three of those eight went to boolean hygiene rather than design: cleaning up slivers thrown off by tangent and coincident faces.

 T3: the real thread 
 The hard task produced the biggest upset. OpenSCAD finished in one version, correct on the first compile, in 43 ms, with no library.

 OpenSCAD has no sweep operation, so the agent wrote the helix as raw vertex and face arithmetic: one four-point ISO profile, 96 sections per turn, emitted as a single polyhedron . There are no guardrails in this code at all. Get the winding order wrong and the tool says nothing.

 module helical_thread(turns, z0) { 
 prof = [ [r_in, - flank_hz], [r_maj, - crest_hz], 
 [r_maj, crest_hz], [r_in, flank_hz] ]; 
 n = round (turns * STEPS); 
 pts = [ for (i = [ 0 :n]) let(a = i * 360 / STEPS, 
 zo = z0 + i * thread_pitch / STEPS) 
 for (j = [ 0 : 3 ]) 
 [ prof[j][ 0 ] * cos (a), prof[j][ 0 ] * sin (a), prof[j][ 1 ] + zo ] ]; 
 fcs = concat( 
 [ [ 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 ] ], 
 [ for (i = [ 0 :n - 1 ]) for (j = [ 0 : 3 ]) let(k = (j + 1 ) % 4 ) 
 [ 4 * i + j, 4 * i + k, 4 * (i + 1 ) + k, 4 * (i + 1 ) + j ] ], 
 [ [ 4 * n + 0 , 4 * n + 1 , 4 * n + 2 , 4 * n + 3 ] ] 
 ); 
 polyhedron (points = pts, faces = fcs, convexity = 8 ); 
 } 
 The agent also pre-empted the classic thread trap before writing a line: an ISO tooth spans exactly one pitch, so consecutive root flats land coplanar and the union goes bad. It sank the swept profile below the minor radius so the helix crosses the core instead of touching it. That is why the boolean was a non-event.

 CadQuery expresses the same geometry in six readable lines, and that part worked first try:

 helix = cq.Wire.makeHelix( pitch = THREAD_P , height = h, radius = R_ROOT , center = ( 0 , 0 , z0)) 
 prof = (cq.Workplane( "XZ" , origin = ( 0 , 0 , z0)).center( R_ROOT , 0 ) 
 .polyline(thread_profile_points()).close()) 
 ridge = prof.sweep(path, isFrenet = True ) 
 
 core = cq.Workplane( "XY" , origin = ( 0 , 0 , z0)).circle( R_ROOT ).extrude(h) 
 rod = core.union(ridge) 
 The failure came on the last line, and it is the one result that changed how we think about the QA loop.

 
 CadQuery T3 version 1 on the left. The threaded section is nothing but floating helical turns. 

 union() silently discarded the core cylinder because the thread root sat exactly on the core radius. Exact tangency along a helical curve, and OCCT dropped a solid without a word. From the outside the part looked perfect. The agent read four renders without noticing. What caught it was a volume measurement: 7065 mm³ where 10323 was expected.

 Worse, the broken part reported valid=True and solids=1 . Raising the boolean tolerance to 1e-3 produced a solid of negative volume that also reported valid=True .

 OpenSCAD is not innocent here either. In T2 its Manifold backend certified Status: NoError for an STL carrying 4 non-manifold edges and 60 zero-area triangles. Neither tool’s self-report is the last word, which is why we parsed every mesh ourselves.

 
 Both finished threads. Crests on the left flank sit half a pitch off those on the right, which is the signature of a true single-start helix and the check that tells a real thread from stacked rings. 

 Download the parts 
 Here are the eight final meshes, exactly as the agents exported them, with no cleanup or repair from us. Binary STL, millimetres, oriented for printing with the part sitting on z = 0.

 Part OpenSCAD CadQuery T1 shelf bracket STL, 2660 tris STL, 4232 tris T2 enclosure box STL, 2944 tris STL, 14136 tris T2 enclosure lid STL, 2960 tris STL, 1872 tris T3 threaded adapter STL, 10754 tris STL, 13748 tris 
 Every one of the eight is watertight, a single connected component, with zero non-manifold edges, zero boundary edges and zero flipped faces. Clearances assume FDM with a 0.4 nozzle, so each T2 pair should snap together as printed.

 The triangle counts are worth a glance, and they do not favour one tool consistently. CadQuery’s box carries almost five times the triangles of the OpenSCAD box, while its lid has fewer. Mesh density here follows how much rounded detail each agent chose to add, not the kernel.

 What we found 
 Renders caught nothing that mattered 
 This is the result we did not expect. Across six runs, images caught coarse blunders, like four mounting posts deleted by a cavity subtraction, and nothing subtle. Every defect that would have ruined a print was found by a number instead: a volume, an angle, an interference test, a strain calculation. In T3 the OpenSCAD agent had the opposite problem and nearly rejected correct geometry, because a thread close-up rendered in a way that looked wrong. Its own note was that the render was not sufficient evidence in either direction.

 The failure modes are mirror images 
 CadQuery fails loudly and early. Its messages are poor, but an exception stops the run, and a stopped model cannot ship by accident. OpenSCAD fails silently and late: in T2 it reported no errors and no warnings across roughly 45 invocations while producing deleted posts, misplaced slots, and a corrupted export it had just certified as clean. For unattended generation, silent success is the more expensive failure.

 CadQuery can be interrogated, OpenSCAD cannot 
 CadQuery answers questions about its own geometry. The T1 agent proved its countersink was 90 degrees and 9 across by reading the cone’s half-angle off the B-rep, then wired the spec into asserts that re-ran on every build. OpenSCAD has no way to query geometry, so both OpenSCAD agents independently wrote binary STL parsers, roughly as much code as the models themselves, to measure what they had built. It works, but it only sees the mesh after export, never the design.

 Speed favours OpenSCAD, and it barely matters 
 Geometry recompute is 30 to 100 times faster, 16 ms against 1.9 s. Inside an agent loop dominated by model inference that is noise. It would matter for a live customizer or a large parameter sweep.

 OpenSCAD renders have no concept of a part edge 
 After CSG there is only a triangle soup, so --view=edges draws the triangulatio
